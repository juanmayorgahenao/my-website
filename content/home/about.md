# Biography

I am a marine data scientist, conservationist, photographer, and explorer dedicated to make a difference in the way we protect, understand, and manage our oceans.  

My work lies at the intersection between data science and marine conservation. I use emerging earth monitoring technologies - in combination with marine ecology, fisheries science, and economics -  to glean insights into our ocean's socio-ecological systems and use them to inform conservation and fisheries management policies.

I currently lead a partnerhsip between the National Geographic Society's Pristine Seas project, the Sustainable Fisheries Group at U.C Santa Barbara, and [Global Fishing Watch](http://globalfishingwatch.org/), to leverage the power of satellite technology, big data, and machine learning to advance marine conservation and fisheries science. By tracking fishing activity around the globe - at very high resolution and in near real time - we are working to transparently analyze trade-offs between conservation and fisheries, highlight threats to unique marine environments, and identify opportunities for innovative conservation.
